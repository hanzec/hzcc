Lexer warning in file ex_trunc1.c line 4
	string literal too long; truncating to "When executed with a mode of 1, your compiler should read the specified input file and divide it into tokens; essentially this is the lexical analysis phase of the compiler (referred to as the “lexer”). The output stream should contain a line for each token, showing the file name, line number, and text corresponding to the token. More details (including the precise output and error formats, and the definitions for the tokens) are given below. The input file may be a C header file, a C source file, or an arbitrary text file. There are opportunities for extra credit.  All implementation must be C, C++, or Java. Instructor permission is required to use anything beyond the standard libraries for these languages. Submissions will be graded on pyrite.cs.iastate.edu, and therefore must build and run correctly there.  Students are strongly encouraged to encapsulate the functionality of this phase of the compiler, so that later parts of the project can easily examine and consume tokens from an input stream. 2 Tok
